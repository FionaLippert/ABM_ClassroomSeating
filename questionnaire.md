To make data collection from the questionnaire as easy as possible:

- As people come in give them a number and record timestamp. Using Python
  program where you just have to enter the number and that number and a
  timestamp are recorded.

- Each individual can then go to google.com/forms/abm and they enter their
  number and seat location aswell as answering the remaining questions.
