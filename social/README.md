# Random Erdos and Renyi Graph

Returns a random graph, also known as an Erdős-Rényi graph or a binomial graph.

The model chooses each of the possible edges with probability p.

## how to use

Following the data from Friday January 19th, 75 people gave information about number of friends and their average number of friends were 16.68. This results in a probability p of 16.68 / 75 = 0.22. The algorithm generates a random graph with n (= 75) and p (= 0.22) and translates it into a numpy array.
